# BracketBalancer
This project implements a program to check if brackets in an arithmetic expression are balanced, using a custom stack implemented with a singly linked list. The program validates expressions containing parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly braces {}. It also supports basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and numbers.
